Sanity + Silex + Twig example
===

This is an example [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) backed frontend for the movies database dataset using [Silex](https://silex.symfony.com) and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com).

## Prerequisites

You will need [PHP](http://php.net) version 5.6 or later as well as [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed on your system

## Setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

    > git clone https://github.com/sanity-io/example-frontend-silex-twig.git

... or [downloading source code](https://github.com/sanity-io/example-frontend-silex-twig/archive/master.zip) code as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

    > composer install

Then start the example app with

    > composer run dev --timeout=0

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000
